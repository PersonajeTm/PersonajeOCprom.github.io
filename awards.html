        <h1 id="titles">Story Reviews</h1>
        <p class="review">Whole With You was a real ride. We start with the usual cutesy couple crap we all know and love, but with some sprinkled foreshadowing and quite a lot of exposition, we get the best of both worlds. Though the story has more fluffy moments than I can count on one hand, I wholeheartedly appreciated the moments where it got more serious, and we were able to get a glimpse of Jasper's past. We delve  less deeply in Seraphina's, but just enough to see a foil to Jasper's situation. Besides one wonderful night of Jenga glory, as the reader we are able to breathe a sigh of relief to see that our little Jasper was able to find not just a romantic partner, but a family to fill the missing bits. One happy, unconventional family.</p><br>
        <p class="review">Winged Boys Dream of Flight was a short and concise story through the lens of a bystander, a close  friend, in Sora and Elio's relationship. Though there are only a few lines of dialogue, it's easy to picture how strong these characters care for each other and the strong bond they have as they reminisce their fond memories together.</p><br>
        <p class="review">Of Monsters And Lesbians Was a great change of pace in contrast to the other stories. Of course, a healthy dosage of couple's fluff, and some monster action to boot. Our main cast consisting of two intelligent monster-hunter ladies. Both on opposite sides of the "out-going" spectrum. Besides the cute couple stuff we get to see something even better, we witness our shy but dangerous hunter experience a very human environment, we see a new side to a character that isn't used to letting loose or letting their guard down. Though its not without its consequences, our main two grow closer as they learn new things about each other and fight Shapeshifter and Sirens to conserve human life.</p><br>
        <p class="review">Not a Let Down tells a very different prom experience for the characters. This story was unique in the sense that instead of a romantic encounters and fluffy exchanges, we get a very real feeling what prom is about. Though the main character is ultimately stood-up by her date, she is still able to enjoy the once-in-lifetime experience without them. Being able to look past, and find comfort in her friends. Arguably, a better ending than the expected soft-cliche that paints a more realistic approach to what Prom  aimed to be, one last hurrah, and a night to share with those who have surrounded you for so many years.</p>
