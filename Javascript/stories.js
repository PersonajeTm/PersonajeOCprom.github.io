    const story1 = `<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; It&rsquo;s already eleven o&rsquo;clock. The grey clouds float and fade away into the darkness of the night and a steady breeze continues to chill the atmosphere. Fewer and fewer cars pass as time goes on. I trace my hand over the same spot on the concrete. His voice replays in my head.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry baby, I won&rsquo;t let you down,&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;I promise you won&rsquo;t be alone this time,&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Okay, but where are you? I check my phone again to see that only a few minutes have passed. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d be here by 9 Mason!&rdquo; I sent at nine fifteen. &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m already on my way,&rdquo; he replies at nine twenty five. &ldquo;Any closer?&rdquo; nine thirty. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; nine forty.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d be here this time...&rdquo; ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">What&rsquo;s the point? I bury my head in my knees. He&rsquo;s not coming. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought this time would be any different.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Arya?&rdquo; a familiar voice echoes in the distance.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">My head pops up to see a vaguely familiar figure approaching from the shadows, the click of their heels getting closer. I couldn&rsquo;t recognize who it was until they stepped out into the faint light of the street lamp. I don&rsquo;t know how I didn&apos;t notice before with her tall, thin build and long untamed curls. She wore a red two-piece along with a noodle strap sparkly top and a knee-length skirt, ruffles all the way down.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Lou?&rdquo; I look up to meet her gaze. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the worried expression I thought she would. All I see is anger and irritation. &ldquo;You look amazing,&rdquo; I force a smile.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Thanks and.. So do you,&rdquo; She leans on the pole of the street light. Seconds silently pass &nbsp;until a sigh finally escapes her lips. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a piece of shit, you know that right?&rdquo; I bury my head deeper into my gut. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know why he gets your hopes up if he knows he&rsquo;s not gonna come. You don&rsquo;t deserve this...&rdquo; Tears sting at my eyes and a tightness rises in my chest. The clink of her footsteps gets louder until I can feel her presence next to me. The sting &nbsp;worsens until I can&rsquo;t force back my tears anymore. In the midst of the chilly night, I feel an abundance of warmth around me.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;I feel like he doesn&rsquo;t even care...&rdquo; I force through the sobs. She doesn&rsquo;t say anything, just continues to comfort me for as long as I need. After a while I wipe my face and smile.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Feel any better?&rdquo; she asks. I nod.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;No problem, I just wish that he could&rsquo;ve tried to be better, especially for you... &rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Suddenly, we both hear footsteps in the distance. Both of our attentions linger on the other side of the street, where a hooded figure makes their way toward us.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be...&rdquo; I whisper.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lou stands up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;ARYA!&rdquo; the figure shouts. It&rsquo;s another feminine voice, one that I could recognize &nbsp;anywhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;AVE!&rdquo; I shouted back. We ran to hug each other, &ldquo;What are you doing here? I thought school events like this weren&rsquo;t your style,&rdquo; I smirked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t, and they still aren&rsquo;t. But I know how you are, and I couldn&rsquo;t just let you sit here at night waiting for that asshole.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I frowned, &ldquo;So you apparently know the future too,&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Yup! And in the near future, I see us at my house eating junk food and watching horror movies with the lights off,&rdquo; Funny how a few seconds ago I was crying my eyes out, but now I couldn&apos;t wipe the grin off my face even if I tried. She always knows exactly what I want to hear, and exactly how to cheer me up. &ldquo;So...&rdquo; she starts again, &ldquo;Are you down?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Tap. Tap. Tap.&nbsp;The footsteps start up again. &ldquo;Yeah, of course!&rdquo;&nbsp;Tap. Tap. Tap.&nbsp;I catch Lou right before she goes in the door and wave her goodbye, right as we start to get going, my phone buzzes. I know who it is, but I&rsquo;m not answering it.&nbsp;Bzzt! Bzzt! Bzzt!&nbsp;It vibrates in my hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;Are you gonna answer?&rdquo; Ave asks. I look at my phone and stare at the contact photo. I remember the day we took it. We look so happy. Oh, how naive I was to think that he&rsquo;d always stick by my side. He can&rsquo;t even come to a damn dance. I silence my phone before catching up with Ave. If he&rsquo;s gonna waste my time, he shouldn&rsquo;t mind me not wanting to answer.</p>`;
    const story2 = `<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; In a deep and dark cave, lit only by the occasional torches and a spell from Finlay, the go-to-magic-light-maker, three wizards traversed through a hellish labyrinth. It seemed like they had been down there for weeks, as they grew tired and hungry.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But right now, Finlay felt a sort of contempt feeling as he cooked the last meal of the &ldquo;day&rdquo;. Finlay often thought he was too young for this, but it was complicated, this feeling. He was a Twiggy, a small youthful looking race, but they aged just like other races. But he had already graduated high school, as Twiggy education was quick. He was 16, almost 17. But he was so boyish and immature even for a Twiggy. He let his mind go to something else, as he served potatoes to his master and his master&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His master was a kind and fair Fee in his 20&rsquo;s named Elio. His golden hair blanketed his eyes. Finlay thought he was the fairest person he&rsquo;d ever met. Like all Fees he had beautiful, translucent wings: his were orange. Small and stumpy horns grew out of his head. He was tall, well anyone other than a Twiggy was huge to him. Finlay was not even four feet tall. He spoke softly and calmly, but stung like a bee in battle when provoked. He was a pacifist, but when his friends were in danger, he&rsquo;d fight like wild. His wide array of magic, his powerful water spells, and his deadly aim with a crossbow made him a tough foe to beat.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His boyfriend was the same age, a Fee like him named Sora. He was tough and a natural fighter, but he was very protective of his friends. Finlay knew very well Sora loved him and Elio. His messy and long blue hair and matching wings appeared to shine in the heat of battle. He would enchant his foes and swing his khopesh. Finlay knew he would be okay with them around.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Finlay was interrupted by his pondering, when Elio poke up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Finlay my lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Master?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You looked really serious all of a sudden. Everything alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes sir. I was just thinking about you guys and&hellip; how you&rsquo;re all so great!&rdquo; Finlay smiled.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Elio smiled, and for a second Finlay thought he could see his eyes under his bangs. Then the yellow-haired wizard laid his head on Sora&rsquo;s shoulder. Sora in response held his hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You guys seem inseparable. When did you first think you were going to be together forever?&rdquo; Finlay said. &ldquo;Ah that sounds weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sora laughed and looked at Elio.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Our prom.&rdquo; Sora said.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Elilo nodded and smiled.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    const story3 = `<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Trigger Warning: Mentions of Suicide and Homophobia</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Birds sang their morning songs outside Jaspers window. It was hard to stay awake listening to them, their songs were almost like sweet lullabies. But Jasper&rsquo;s thoughts, that raced as fast as her groggy morning mind would let, kept her awake.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Will she say yes? She&rsquo;ll probably say yes&hellip; But what if she doesn&rsquo;t like how I prompose?&nbsp;She thought to herself.&nbsp;You only get one chance Jasper. Make her as happy she&rsquo;s made you with this!... If that&rsquo;s even possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She turned in her bed. Using one hand she blindly looked for her phone, just barely grabbing it from the other side of her double bed. She looked at her phone, cringing from the brightness a bit before her eyes adjusted and she could see her wallpaper of her girlfriend clearly. It was a nice picture of Seraphina she thought. The sunlight glistened off her dark skin, her golden eyes clearly looking into the camera even though Jasper had tried to take a sneaky photo. She could never hide herself from Seraphina. Jasper finally looked to time. It was nine am&hellip; Nine am? She was late!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper shot herself from bed. She scrambled for her clothes, just putting on an old band tee, jeans and a hoodie. They&rsquo;d do for now. She grabbed her bag, making sure she had everything she needed for her promposal inside before jumping down her house stairs, just barely sticking the landing. She went straight toward the door, ignoring her stomach&apos;s new found desire for breakfast.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Finally up are ya?&rdquo; Jasper heard a shrill voice ask from the kitchen.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She stuck her head into the kitchen. Her mother sat at a small table by the window sipping a drink.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No thanks to you.&rdquo; Jasper replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ahh, was it thanks to that lesbian then? Thought I told ya to stay away from that whore.&rdquo; Her mother spat at her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And I thought I told you that your the only fecken whore I know, Ma.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak like that to me, you!&rdquo; Her mother screamed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak about Seraphina like that then.&rdquo; Jasper spoke, as calm as her nerves would let her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak however I want in me own house!.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well good thing this isn&rsquo;t your house then innit!&rdquo; She said, finally rasing her own voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before her mother could reply, if she was even going to, Jasper turned and left for school. She was already late as is, she wasn&rsquo;t going to let her mother make her even later.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">*</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Seraphina looked into her mirror, making sure her new yellow jumper fit well. She thought it looked nice with her white skirt. She grabbed her phone, pausing to look at her wallpaper of Jasper lying down and strumming a guitar, her short blond hair just barely covered her emerald eyes in the picture. A wide smile was on Jasper&rsquo;s face, she always smiled while she played guitar. It was her favourite part of watching Jasper play.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked to the time: seven fifty. She put on her shoes and left for the kitchen.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Walking down the stairs she could hear a light singing coming from the kitchen: her mother. She always liked to sing some French songs that reminded her of home.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bonjour.&rdquo; Seraphina said to her parents as she walked in.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, morning, Sera.&rdquo; Her father said, his attention finally broken from her singing mother.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hello honey. Do you have everything ready for your proposal?&rdquo; Her mother asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Almost, just have one more picture to add then it&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo; She replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her father chuckled. &ldquo;I still take one hundred percent credit for the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The women in the room laughed. &ldquo;Sure, Papa.&rdquo; Seraphina said.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The laughing died down. Seraphina sat down at the kitchen table and poured some tea, sipping it as she let her thoughts wander.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Mama?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, honey?&rdquo; Her mother said, coming to sit down at the table.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;D-Do you think Jasper will like the promposal?&rdquo; Seraphina asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course she will dear. You put thought and care into it, and Jasper will love it.&rdquo; Her mother replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her father spoke up. &ldquo;Jasper does have good taste after all. She is with you, isn&rsquo;t she.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina smiled a bit. &ldquo;Thanks you two, couldn&rsquo;t do it without you.&rdquo; She said as she hugged her parents.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, dear.&rdquo; Her mother said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t wait to see you two all dressed up for prom.&rdquo; Her father said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll look so beautiful.&rdquo; Her mother agreed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked at her phone. &ldquo;I should get going. Thanks again for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Seraphina. Have a good day at school.&rdquo; Her mother said, as she left. Her father just waved her goodbye as he bit into a sandwich.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">*</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Jasper held her bag tight as she walked towards the school doors. She had her prom-posal in that bag, and was going through all the ways she could actually do it in her head.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A dark haired boy a bit smaller than Jasper walked up to her. &ldquo;Seraphina&rsquo;s at her locker.&rdquo; He told her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; to you too, Devin.&rdquo; She replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Right, good morning, sorry.&rdquo; He said as they walked. &ldquo;Anyways Evan is with her right now but he has to go in a minute so if you wanna do your prom-posal now, then honey we gotta run.&rdquo; He said, gently pushing Jasper forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper took the hint and picked up the pace. &ldquo;All my stuff is in my bag. Devin, can you distract Sera while I get them ready?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin was panting heavily, running was not something he enjoyed. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll figure something out.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They came to a corner and stopped to catch their breaths, mainly for Devin. Jasper peaked around the corner - Seraphina stood at her locker, organizing her books or something it seemed. She liked to do that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper looked to Devin who still looked out of breath. &ldquo;You ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin looked Jasper right in the eyes. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Great, lets go.&rdquo; Jasper said, dragging him around the corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina saw them coming and quickly closed her locker door. Strange, Jasper thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; babe.&rdquo; Jasper said, pecking Seraphina on the cheek.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Good morning, Jas.&rdquo; Seraphina looked to Devin, who was still panting slightly. &ldquo;Are you ok, Devin?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin walked around Seraphina, getting Jasper &nbsp;out of her line of sight. &ldquo;No, Seraphina I need your help. Do you have the homework for Mr. P done?&rdquo; He said, sounding &nbsp;panicked. His drama club experience was coming in handy, Jasper thought.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper sat her bag down as quickly and quiet as she possibly could. She unzipped it and carefully pulled out a balloon that read &lsquo;Will you go to Prom with me?&rsquo; and a framed picture of her and Seraphina smiling at a picnic with a message on the back saying &lsquo;I love your smile&rsquo;. She held the picture and turned the balloon so it showed its message.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded to Devin, he gestured back to her and Seraphina turned around.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper stood there, beet red and looked at her girlfriend who gasped at the sight. &ldquo;W-Will you go to prom with me, Sera?&rdquo; She asked sheepishly.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tears welled up in Seraphina&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; She answered, hugging Jasper close. &ldquo;Oh, you look so cute when you&rsquo;re embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper grumbled at this, but held Seraphina closer.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina let go of her, tears sliding gently down her face. She opened her locker and pulled Jasper over to look into it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a collage - No, a shrine, to their relationship. Every picture from a major event in their relationship from their first month anniversary to their most recent Valentines day together surround the words &lsquo;Will you go to Prom with me?.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo; Jasper said. She looked to Seraphina who waited for her answer. Jasper pulled her in and kissed her. &ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo; She said after.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So is that a yes?&rdquo; Seraphina asked with a laugh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper laughed too. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">*</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Jasper looked to her feet, testing the comfortability of her red shoes. They had a small heel so she&rsquo;d have to be careful when dancing.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Dancing?&nbsp;Jasper thought.&nbsp;When was the last time we danced? I don&rsquo;t know. Oh no, I&rsquo;m gonna step on her toes aren&rsquo;t I?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper looked up into the mirror. Her worry broken by some self indulgent pride in her looks. Her makeup was perfect, her blue three piece suit fit perfectly and her red nails could safely hide the blood of her enemies.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Only thing missing is Sera.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper looked to the time, picked up her green boutirr&eacute;ere for Seraphina and went to leave. As she walked through her home she turned out the lights. She waited at the door and listened out for anything...nothing. The house was empty, her mother gone who knows where for who knows how long.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper left, locking the door behind her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">*</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Seraphina looked to her feet, testing the comfortability of her blue heels. They were nice shoes and she was comfortable in heels but she knew she&rsquo;d fumble when dancing, even just a bit.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">So long as it&rsquo;s with Jasper.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up into the mirror, happy with her appearance and confident that Jasper would love it all, from makeup, to hair, down to the dress.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked to her phone for the time, took her yellow boutirr&eacute;ere for Jasper and went downstairs to wait for Jasper.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Coming down the stairs she was greeted by her mother holding her camera and her father trying to hold back tears.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her mother looked her up and down. &ldquo;Oh honey you look fantastic! Hold still a second I wanna get some photos.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina put down the boutirr&eacute;ere and posed for some photos.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Her father could no longer hold back his tears. He spoke through sobs. &ldquo;Oh my god. One day I&rsquo;m tying your shoes and the next your dressed up to the nines and going to prom with your girlfriend.&rdquo; He continued in french. &ldquo;My little girl is all grown up! I&rsquo;m gonna have a heart attack if you marry, I swear to god.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s mother teared up a bit now too, and the thought of marriage teared Seraphina up now too.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Honey, please, your gonna make us all cry.&rdquo; Her mother said to her father.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her father just nodded and went off to the kitchen for a drink.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s mother turned back to her. &ldquo;Your father, I swear.&rdquo; She laughed to herself a bit. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t cried like that since the day you were born you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He cried when I was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes, quite a bit. His father told him to man up and &lsquo;stop crying over something so dumb&rsquo;.&rdquo; She began to laugh. &ldquo;So your father gave you back to me and punched the old bastard. Said &lsquo;don&rsquo;t call my daughter dumb&rsquo; and kicked him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina laughed with her mother. Her gramps had cheated on her grandma and shown how horrid of a man he was in recent years, so it was a good story to hear.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to set up the camera on a tripod for later. You go sit down.&rdquo; Her mother said, going off to her work. She was a professional photographer and took pride in her skills. She was waiting for this day just as much as Seraphina had.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She sat down and her father came back, all tears done. For now.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A knock came from the door. Seraphina sat up and her father went to answer the knock. He looked in the mirror, putting on his sternest face before opening the door.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not even a second later Seraphina could hear Jasper break out in laughter.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper spoke between the laughs. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. LaRue, stern does not suit you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s father laughed too. &ldquo;How many times have I told you Jasper, call me Stephen.&rdquo; He ushered her in, complimented Jasper&rsquo;s suit and left her to Seraphina.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina and Jasper looked each other up and down. They had planned out their outfits together for the little details, such as shoes and nails to match each other&apos;s outfits, and boutirr&eacute;ere to match each other&apos;s eyes. But they had never seen the outfits till now.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You look great.&rdquo; They said in unison, and laughed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper took out the green boutirr&eacute;ere. &ldquo;Here let me put this on ya.&rdquo; She said, and Seraphina let her. Jasper fumbled with putting the boutirr&eacute;ere on Seraphina&rsquo;s wrist but got it eventually.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina took out the yellow boutirr&eacute;ere, and went to pin it on Jasper&rsquo;s jacket but paused.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What&apos;s wrong?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked at her with a thinking face. &ldquo;Are you gonna be wearing the jacket all night?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper thought about it for a second. &ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo; She shrugged.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina moved the jacket out of the way and pinned the boutirr&eacute;ere to Jasper&rsquo;s suit brace. &ldquo;That should do.&rdquo; She said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper lightly kissed Seraphina on the cheek. &ldquo;Thanks babe.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s father laughed from the other side of &nbsp;the hallway. &ldquo;Get a room you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper resisted saying ok and leading Seraphina to her own room.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s mother came back from setting up her camera. &ldquo;You look amazing, Jasper.&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;Would you too mind coming over here for some photos?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper looked to Seraphina, and they nodded. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; They said in unison with a chuckle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">They took a good number of pictures, some of just the couple, some with Seraphina&rsquo;s parents, and some without Jasper&rsquo;s jacket to get the boutirr&eacute;eres in.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s father looked at some of the pictures of all of them. &ldquo;Aww, look at us. One big happy family.&rdquo; He hugged the girls. &ldquo;You two going now, or are you gonna be here a bit longer?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked to her phone for the time. &ldquo;We should probably get going actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s mother spoke. &ldquo;Ok, well have fun you two and be safe.&rdquo; She said hugging the girls herself.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Not too much fun though!&rdquo; Seraphina&rsquo;s father said as they went to the door.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The girls said their byes in unison, as they liked to do, and left for Prom.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">*</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Jasper had parked the car in the same place every day for school ever since she got the car. But today was a special day, it was Prom night, and someone was parked in Jasper&rsquo;s spot.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Fucken bitch.&rdquo; Jasper mumbled to herself as she scanned the school&apos;s parking lot. Seraphina just giggled to herself.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper found a spot close enough to the entrance and parked. She got out of the car, went around and opened the door for Seraphina, like a true Lady.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The two walked hand in hand to the entrance where Devin stood in an immaculate black suit next to his boyfriend, Evan, who wore a dark blue dress.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Evening, Ladies.&rdquo; Evan waved.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, Ladies.&rdquo; Devin said. &ldquo;See Jasper, I said hi this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper laughed. &ldquo;Ye, good work, Devin.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We all ready?&rdquo; Seraphina asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin and Evan readily said yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper gripped Seraphina&rsquo;s hand tight and nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The music could be heard banging all the way outside the building. Inside the building, it was deafening.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The group weaved through crowds of people nodding and speaking into others ears till they came to an empty table. Well, it was empty after they covertly moved the prior occupants stuff to an empty, shitier table.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They sat down at the newly procured table, Jasper and Devin taking off their coats and pulling out chairs for their respective partner.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin spoke loudly to be heard over the music. &ldquo;HEY! ME AND JASPER ARE GONNA GO AND GET SHIT!&rdquo; He said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The dresses nodded their approval and the suits went off to &lsquo;get shit&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As Devin and Jasper walked to the food table they saw the different games that were gonna be available for the Prom Royalty games. These games were used to select Prom Royalty instead of the usual voting which was rigged one too many times for the liking of everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was an area designated to each of the six games. There was giant chess, giant jenga, cakewalk, a slingshot shooting range, and a small stage for a fashion and talent show that they also used for any announcements. It was a good mix of games. Jasper felt she and Seraphina had a good shot of winning them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin and Jasper got to the food table. There was a good selection of cakes, sandwiches and even some nice brownies. The two checked everything to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t spiked. Some of the brownies were actually weed brownies they discovered.... They took all the weed brownies they could find.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Getting back to the table Devin immediately spoke up. &ldquo;Oh you two ain&rsquo;t gonna believe this.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked to Jasper incredulously. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper placed down the plate stacked with brownies. &ldquo;Someone snuck edibles onto the food tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Evan laughed. &ldquo;Oh my god, those are edibles?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin took one and ate it whole. As he was chewing he was analyzing it, thinking about the flavour and the punch of the brownie. &ldquo;These are brownies from the weed shop downtown. Get a very lite buzz off one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Evan immediately ate two, giggling to himself the entire time.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina just smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m betting twenty bucks it was Steve Marshal.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh fuck yea, it was definitly Steve.&rdquo; Jasper laughed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The group sat, chatted and ate food for a bit. Seraphina elected to not eat any of the edibles. Jasper elected to have many however.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The music relaxed and a woman in a nice dress suit walked onto the small stage. She tapped the mic a few times sending feedback through the speakers, and cleared her throat. &ldquo;Hello everybody! I hope you&apos;re having fun so far.&rdquo; The woman spoke in a tone so happy and joyful it could make a unicorn sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;For any of those interested the signups for Prom Royalty games are opening up for the next 20 minutes. We are only accepting a certain amount of couples for the games. Umm, you do not have to be in a relationship with your partner just sign up with a friend if you want.&rdquo; She gestured to a small table next to the stage. &ldquo;The signup area is right here next to the stage so I hope to see plenty of people go to sign up. We&rsquo;ll announce the first game being done after the 20 minutes for signup is up. Have fun everyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She sounds like she needs an edible.&rdquo; Evan joked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper held Seraphina&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Hey, I saw some of the games earlier. I think we&rsquo;d have a chance of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina rolled the thought around in her head. &ldquo;You think we could win?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I think we have a good chance. And it&rsquo;d be fun anyways. One of the games is giant jenga.&rdquo; Jasper responded.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina smiled. &ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s go sign up then, can&rsquo;t pass up giant jenga.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper turned to the other two at the table. &ldquo;You two wanna sign up with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Devin and Evan looked at each other, transmitting their thoughts as all gay couples do. &ldquo;Nah, I think we&rsquo;re good.&rdquo; Devin answered.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ok then, look after our stuff while we sign up then.&rdquo; Said Seraphina.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The ladies went to sign up, and twenty minutes later the first game was announced: A talent show.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; Jasper said to Seraphina.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well good, cause I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do for a talent show.&rdquo; Seraphina replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh shush, your a great singer, Sera.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You always say that. So what are you thinking of doing?&rdquo; Seraphina asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper watched as they set up a keyboard on the stage for the first performer. She went through the library of music in her mind, trying to pick the most visually impressive guitar piece she knew. It was supposed to be a show after all, a nice sounding piece will only go so far.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna do &lsquo;Through The Fire and The Flames&rsquo;, what do you think?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh that should work great! Will be safe to say the judges have no taste if you don&rsquo;t win.&rdquo; Seraphina answered.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper watched the pianist play. It was some classical piece she couldn&rsquo;t recognise, but it had some flare to it. The pianist&apos;s hands worked wildly over the piano the entire piece.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper held Seraphina&rsquo;s hand tight.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo; Seraphina asked, holding Jasper&rsquo;s hand in both of hers.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Little bit.&rdquo; She admitted, placing her head on Seraphina&rsquo;s shoulder as they watched another step on stage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Finally, it was Jasper&rsquo;s turn, going last. She stepped onto the small stage, a pristine all black electric guitar in her grip. It was her favourite one the school had. Not only because of the colour that matched her wardrobe most of the time, but for it&rsquo;s feel. Jasper couldn&rsquo;t really explain it, but the guitar just felt right in her grip. Better than even the guitars she owned at home.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily, she had a deal to buy it off the school after graduation.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper finished hooking the guitar up to the amp, and looked into the watching crowd. She saw Seraphina up front, standing with the other Prom Royalty contestants, and felt her chest lighten as she began to play.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper didn&rsquo;t remember exactly when she began to play guitar, but she remembered why - Her father.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her father was an American man born in Boston, so like many he had Irish ancestry, and like so many others he had an interest in Ireland. This interest brought him to Ireland in his youth where he learned guitar from a patron in a pub he worked. He would play classic Irish music with the man in the pub, and he enjoyed every second of it he would say.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;After a while the man stopped going to the pub, and after a while longer her father became worried. He was a frequent visitor, often coming on the weekend to relax after a tough week of work. He&rsquo;s absence was strange. So he followed up on his worries and visited the man home, where he met the man&rsquo;s daughter: Her mother. It was love at first sight, he would say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually her father felt it was time to go home to America, and he took her mother with him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her father died on her seventh birthday. The same day he gave her her first guitar. Her mother destroyed that guitar almost eight years later.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Jasper&rsquo;s thoughts cleared as she finished playing. She looked up and saw people clapping. She looked to Seraphina who was recording the entire thing, and smiled.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper put the guitar with the other instrument and summoned back to the stage with the others who performed.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; The announcement woman began. &ldquo;I think we can all agree that everyone did fantastically, and deserve a round of applause.&rdquo; She clapped, as did a good few of the crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; She said, trying to sound as sad and &nbsp;sympathetic as possible. &ldquo;Only one can win the round, and after discussing it with the judges we have chosen the winner of the talent show. And that winner is Jasper O&rsquo;Callaghan!&rdquo; The woman said, urging the crowd to clap. And they did.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She shooed Jasper and the other contestants off the stage and announced the next game: A fashion show.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina was excited.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper looked at her quizzically. &ldquo;You excited?&rdquo; &nbsp;She asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited.&rdquo; Seraphina stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Seraphina was a quiet, soft spoken and kind hearted person. She would often go out of her way to help others in any regard. She was a saintly person. Her only sin was pride.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina did her best to feel good and look good, she took pride in this, and today was a day where she took just a bit extra.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper watched Seraphina walk onto the stage with the others that&rsquo;d be doing the fashion show. She was already walking like she was on a cat walk and Jasper couldn&rsquo;t keep her eyes off her. She tracked Seraphina as she did the catwalk, the other contestants just seemed like blurry blobs in her sight as she focused herself, and her phone camera, on the only one that mattered.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the catwalk was done. It was a shorter and simpler affair then the talent show. The judges lined all the contestants up and the announcer woman announced the winner. A young woman named Julie who Jasper finally noticed was dressed not unlike a gothic peacock.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina came back noticeably annoyed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper hugged her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat &apos;em next time, hon.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked to her, and nodded.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The next game was announced to be slingshot shooting. The rules for this was simple: Hit all the targets you can and the person who hits the most wins.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it.&rdquo; Seraphina stated, her voice tinged with determination.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ok. Are you good though, babe?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Just a tad annoyed.&rdquo; She answered.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper held her hand. &ldquo;You wanna talk about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina smiled as their team&apos;s turn was called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; She kissed Jasper on the cheek and went up to represent them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She gripped the slingshot like an army soldier whose life depended on the weapon in their hands, and when the targets went up: she let loose. Seraphina hit every target within seconds of each other. Even the moving targets in the far back no one hit before her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She put down the slingshot, the foam of the handle now shaped to her hand, and went to give Jasper a hug. &ldquo;That was fun.&rdquo; She said with a laugh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the others finished their turns it was announced that Seraphina had won for them by a landslide!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper gave her a celebratory kiss for that.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The next game was announced to be giant chess. And just as fast as they went to play, they lost.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I hate chess.&rdquo; Jasper remarked.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina put her head on Jasper&rsquo;s shoulder, a bit dejected. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They announced the next game was giant jenga. The rules were simple for this round, just play to the last couple standing.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were eight couples in total including Jasper and Seraphina. And after winning an uneventful first game and second game, there were only two couples left. And the gothic peacock was apart of the other couple with her friend.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper went first for them, carefully taking a larger than average jenga piece out.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Next went the gothic peacocks partner who fumbled a piece out, just barely managing to keep the tower from falling.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina went next, also barely managing to keep the tower from falling. As she went back to Jasper she saw her taking a napkin from her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Follow my lead.&rdquo; She whispered as she stood beside her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;When the gothic peacock squatted down to carefully take a piece out, Jasper ripped the napkin. &ldquo;Hey Phi, did ya hear something rip?&rdquo; She asked loudly.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina smiled. &ldquo;Yea, I think it might have been Julie&apos;s dress, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Gothic peacock shot up, knocking the tower over and frantically checking her dress and ordering her friend to check too. Much to everyone&apos;s amusement.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The announcer gave the win to the girls who have now won 3 out of the 5 games done so far. Since no else had a won over one game, the win was already as good as theirs.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina laughed as they walked over to the final game with everyone. &ldquo;Oh my god, I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d react like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper couldn&rsquo;t help but snort laugh a few times. &ldquo;I know right?! I thought she was gonna shoot out the dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The final game was cakewalk. Rules for this were you walk till the music stops and check a box next to your number to see what you won. All boxes have the name of a prize in it which was simple stuff from sweets to headphones. Only one box gave the win for the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The music began, and they walked hand in hand over the numbers.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina laughed to herself a bit. &ldquo;This has been fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper held her hand tight. &ldquo;Aye, it has.&rdquo; Jasper held Seraphina&rsquo;s hand in both of hers. &ldquo;Thanks for picking me for Prom.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course. Who else was I gonna go with, dummy?&rdquo; Seraphina chuckled, holding Jasper close.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Just&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; Jasper began. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The music stopped. &ldquo;Ok, now everyone look down and see what you won!&rdquo; The announcer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone opened their boxes one after the other announcing what they won. Jasper knelt down and picked up the box. She opened it with Seraphina looking over her shoulder and took out the little piece of paper inside. &ldquo;We won the game!&rdquo; Jasper exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The announcer went over to double check, announcing that Seraphina and Jasper did indeed win the cake walk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&ldquo;It is with great joy,&rdquo; The announcer began. &ldquo;That I introduce this year&apos;s Prom Royalty! With four out of six wins in this year&rsquo;s game, give a round of applause to our Queen&rsquo;s! Seraphina LaRue and Jasper O&rsquo;Callaghan!&rdquo; She began to clap quickly followed by the crowd of Prom goers.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper and Seraphina walked onto the stage to the clapping hand in hand, wearing their plastic but still very well made crowns. They were made by the prop team in the drama club which included Devin, they&rsquo;d have to applaud him for his handy work later.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They stood next to the announcer on the stage, some applause still going on. Evan from their table in the back wolf whistled over the crowd, causing many to laugh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The announcer cleared her throat, gaining a bit of silence from the crowd. &ldquo;Now, as custom our royalty will pick a song to play for their dance! So ladies, what song would you like to play?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina looked to Jasper. &ldquo;You pick.&rdquo; She said with a look that made Jasper think she knew what she would say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper spoke into the mic. &ldquo;We like to play &lsquo;Pieces&rsquo; by Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Pieces it is!&rdquo; The announcer said, ushering the ladies onto the dancefloor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">As the song began to play the two held each other close. Slowly dancing.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper put her hide on Seraphina&rsquo;s chest and her thoughts began to wander.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Four years.&nbsp;She thought.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been four years since that night.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Four years ago Jasper went home late from school to find her mother destroying her room, screaming every expletive the small minded woman knew. When she saw Jasper just standing behind her she went into a tirad. &ldquo;You dertay faggot!&rdquo; She screamed. &ldquo;How long did ya think you could hide it from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper couldn&rsquo;t even say anything. Her silence didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Vanessa told me!&rdquo; She continued screaming. &ldquo;She told me all about yur little faggetity thoughts!&rdquo; She picked up a picture of Jasper&apos;s father off her bedside table. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be ashamed of ya!&rdquo; She screamed, throwing the picture straight for Jasper&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper ducked out of the way, falling to the ground.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Get out of me house ya lying fag!&rdquo; Her mother screamed coming out of her room throwing anything she could get her hands on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper scrambled from the ground and ran for down. She fell down the stairs as she ducked another throw item. Jasper jumped to her feet as her mother came screaming after her, and she ran out the door and into the night.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;And she ran, and ran, and ran, and ran. She had nowhere to go. Her cousin, Vanessa, had told her mother her deepest secret. She had been worried about how her mother would react to her discovering her sexuality, how her mother would react to her daughter being a lesbian. So she told her cousin her fears and worries, and now they were all coming to.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper didn&rsquo;t know where she was. She had run for miles and was tired and she just wanted&hellip; she didn&rsquo;t wanna think about what she may have wanted, but instead she found what she needed but didn&rsquo;t know at the time. She found her classmate at the time a young beautiful black girl named Seraphina LaRue. Funnily enough, she was the same person who made her question her sexuality. And as she saw her face, she fell to her knees and cried.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina had run up to her, she had recognised her and asked if she was alright. She took Jasper to her home that night, it was just around the corner from where they met, and they talked. Jasper told her through tears about what had happened&hellip; She told her she wanted to die. She felt like her world had broken into little pieces. And through it all, Seraphina sat there listening, soothing her when needed and trying to distract her from what happened to her. They listened to music, &lsquo;Pieces&rsquo; by Red in particular. A bad choice, Seraphina had joked at the time. But Jasper liked it. Jasper fell asleep in Seraphina&rsquo;s arms that night. She felt safe there.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper looked up into Seraphina&rsquo;s golden eyes as they danced in each other&apos;s arms on the Prom dance floor. With tears in her own eyes, Jasper spoke. &ldquo;Thank you for making me whole, Seraphina.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Seraphina could even reply, Jasper held her tight and kissed her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">*</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Jasper parked the car into Seraphina&rsquo;s driveway. She got out and opened the door for Seraphina.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well that was a fun night.&rdquo; Seraphina said with a laugh, as she got out.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yea.&rdquo; Jasper said, taking off her crown. &ldquo;It really was.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They walked to the house door and opened it. Seraphina&rsquo;s parents were on the other side with a box.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome back!&rdquo; They said together.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s mother handed her the box. &ldquo;We got you two a little something.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And you have to open it now.&rdquo; Her father added &ldquo;I wanna see your reactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina put the box down on the kitchen table and opened it with Jasper beside her. Inside they saw two pictures. One was a picture of them in their crowns they&rsquo;d sent after they took it framed in a gold and green frame. The other was a picture taken of them in the house framed in a classic black frame.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The girls said together.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper stretched a little bit and yawned. &ldquo;Well, I should get going.&rdquo; She said.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seraphina&rsquo;s father stopped her when she got to the door. &ldquo;Your always welcome to stay here ya know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I don&rsquo;t wanna be a bother.&rdquo; She replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jasper.&rdquo; Seraphina&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;Your like a second daughter to us, and a parent is never bothered by their child.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Jasper froze, her hand stuck to the door handle with it partly open. She thought to herself, and closed the door.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;She turned with some tears in her eyes and hugged Seraphina&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Anytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They went back and sat in the kitchen with everyone else, and talked for the night. About the present, the past, and the future.</p>
